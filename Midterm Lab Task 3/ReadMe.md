## Midterm Lab Task 3

 A Pivot Table is a powerful data analysis tool in Excel that allows users to summarize, analyze, explore, and present large sets of data in a concise and organized way. It enables you to extract meaningful insights by rearranging, sorting, and filtering data dynamically without altering the original dataset.

## Step By Step

1. Use the worksheet with uncleaned data sets for jobs and the transformation tables:  
   - Salary by Role  
   - Salary by State  
   - Salary by Company Size

2. Design a dashboard that highlights the following:  
   - State with the highest number of Data Science jobs  
   - Job role with the highest average salary  
   - Company size that offers the highest pay  
   - Sector with the lowest and highest number of Data Science-related jobs  
   - Sector with the minimum and maximum average salary  
     (Note: You will need to create a separate query to build pivot tables for points d and e)

3. Create necessary Pivot Tables and corresponding charts for the required reports.

4. Add slicers for Role Type, Company Size, and State to make the dashboard interactive.

5. If your version of Excel supports it, you can insert a map (refer to the sample map for guidance).

6. Feel free to apply your own design and color settings to enhance the appearance and presentation of your dashboard.

7. The provided dashboard template is incomplete; you need to finish it and include all the necessary visuals/reports outlined in step 2.

8. Ensure that the slicers allow for interactivity within your dashboard.
