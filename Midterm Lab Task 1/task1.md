# Midterm Lab Task 1
- This portolfio showcases of what was done for the Midterm Lab Task 1

## Step by step process
1. Remove Duplicates
   - Select the range of data you want to clean.
   - Go to the **Data** tab and click on **Remove Duplicates**.
   - Choose the columns to check for duplicates and click **OK**.

2. Handle Missing Data
   - Look for empty cells or missing data. You can filter for blanks by selecting the **Filter** option under the **Data** tab.
   - Fill in missing values manually, use formulas (e.g., `IF` statements), or replace them with a placeholder like "N/A" or the average of the column.

3. Standardize Data Format
   - Ensure consistent formats across your data (e.g., date formats, currency symbols).
   - Use the **Text to Columns** feature to separate data into different columns if needed, or apply **Find & Replace** to standardize text.
